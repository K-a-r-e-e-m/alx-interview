# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangular form. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in Pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two numbers just above the number. Pascals triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc.

## What is Pascal's Triangle Used For?
Pascals triangle can be used for various purposes in mathematics. It is used in the binomial expansion of a polynomial, in probability, to find the number of combinations, and can be used to find the Fibonacci series. Pascal's triangle is a very useful tool and has various properties that can be useful in various aspects of mathematics.

## What is The Rule for Pascal's Triangle?
The rule that Pascal's triangle has is that we start with 1 at the top, then 1s at both sides of the triangle until the end. The middle numbers, each is the sum of the two consecutive numbers just above it. Hence to construct a Pascal's triangle we just need to add the two numbers just above the number.

## What is Pascal's Triangle Formula?
Pascal's formula is used to find the element in the Pascal triangle. The formula for Pascal's triangle is nCm = n-1Cm-1 + n-1Cm

where

- nCm represents the (m+1)th element in the nth row.

- n is a non-negative integer, and

- 0 ≤ m ≤ n.


## What are 3 Patterns In Pascal's Triangle?
The three patterns in the Pascals triangle are:

- The sum of values in the nth row is 2n. For. example we have the values in the 4th row 1 4 6 4 1, and the sum of these elements is 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16 = 24.
- If a row has the second element which is a prime number, then all the following elements in the row are divisible by that prime number(not considering 1s), for. ex. 1 5 10 10 5 1.
- By adding the different diagonals elements of a Pascals triangle, we get the Fibonacci series.
